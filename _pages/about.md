This is Lifu Tu's home on the web!

I am a research scientist at Salesforce AI Research. I got my Ph.D. from [TTI-Chicago](https://ttic.edu/), a philanthropically endowed academic computer science institute located on the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) campus.

My current research focus is on natural language processing and deep learning, especially energy-based models and approximated inference networks. I am also doing some work on model robustness and representation learning.
